1.	INTRODUCTION.
This project is a North American-specific preset for JOSM, meant for use with OpenRailwayMap tagging on OpenStreetMap.

This preset is not meant to be comprehensive - it is meant to be fast, only cover the most critical applications, and serve as a tool to help us all tag consistently according to the wiki page at OpenRailwayMap/Tagging in North America.  For less common tag combinations and especially combinations that aren't North America-specific, it is definitely still recommended to install the comprehensive DE Infrastructure preset from the OpenRailwayMap team.

2.	INSTALL:
It is currently recommended to install this preset directly from the packaged copy kept on the author's server.  The install link is contained in the file "server address.txt" within the project.  To install, open JOSM's preset preferences window, and click the "+" button to the right to add a preset that isn't on the default list.  Paste the link directly into the "File / URL" text box, and hit OK twice to apply and close the preferences boxes.  The preset will appear with the others in your list.  As a tip, it also speeds things up tremendously to add it to your toolbar.

3.	TO UPDATE:
By default, JOSM caches downloaded presets, and doesn't look for an update until the next update of JOSM itself.  There is not a manual update button, and this is a longstanding bug in JOSM.  To force an update, go to your cache directory for JOSM:

	Windows:	C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\JOSM\cache

	macOS:		Users/<YourName>/Library/Caches/JOSM/cache

	Linux:		My Linux machine is down - so if you know, please let me know so I can add it!  May vary by distro.

Once in the cache directory, find a file named "mirror_http___www.aturnofthenut.com_distribute_osm_naps_ORM_NAPS.zip" and simply delete it.  Then restart JOSM, and the latest version will automatically be downloaded and reinstalled.
